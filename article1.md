## Much of the Advice is good Advice

We know for sure that this is damn good advice. However for some people in some situations opinions may vary. It is important to state here that this variation is already been accounted for so that still almost all of this advice is generally good advice for everybody.


## Advisory Board needed
It seems that a board of advisors might help to generate good advice. Usually they have to be paid, but if they value good advice then we could have the rare case of perpetum generabile of good advice. 

**This is the singularity!**
